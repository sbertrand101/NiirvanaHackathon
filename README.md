# NiirvanaHackathon
This is an interactive weekly journal program created for Niirvana that prompts the user with reflection questions, waits for the user's response, and saves the responses as journal entries.

# Installation
To use this program, you must have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the following Python packages:

- tkinter (for GUI version only)
- PySimpleGUI (for PySimpleGUI version only)
You can install these packages using pip, a package installer for Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following commands:

```
# bash
# For tkinter version
pip install tkinter

# For PySimpleGUI version
pip install PySimpleGUI
```

# Usage
To run the program, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the journal.py file is located. Then enter the following command:

```
#bash
python journal.py
```

This will launch the program and display the first reflection question.

Enter your response in the text field provided and click the "Submit" button. The program will save your response and display the next reflection question.

Continue entering your responses until you have completed all of the reflection questions. Once you have finished, the program will display your journal entries.
